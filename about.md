Chances are, I am very much like you, just completely different. You most likey ended up here because we have something in common - some shared interest or point of view. 

### Interests

I like to use my mind - whether it is to daydream, contemplate or do some actual problem-solving. I also enjoy making things with words or notes, writing and making music. Sometimes I knit or learn something new. I try to exercise regularily by running or working out. Mostly I just love existing.

Best regards,
Me.
